The most versatile no-code solution for WordPress!

== Description ==

**Convoworks WP** is more than just a conversation tool. It's a sophisticated no-code, universal workflow builder seamlessly integrated into your WordPress. Rooted in Convoworks, an [open source PHP framework](https://github.com/zef-dev/convoworks-core), you can craft intricate workflows without typing a single line of code.

Convoworks employs visual programming, allowing users to design workflows through a drag-and-drop interface, much like a visual flowchart. These workflows can then be executed by various triggers, including REST-based interactions and WordPress hooks.

Initially focused on Amazon Alexa, Convoworks now boasts a broader horizon, supporting platforms such as Viber, FB Messenger, and web chat. With platform adapters, Convoworks ensures seamless communication across platforms.

For users familiar with visual builders like Elementor or Divi, Convoworks is a game-changer. While these visual builders handle design and layout, Convoworks allows you to take dynamic functionality a step further. Now, without writing a line of code, you can:

* Tweak website behaviors using WordPress hooks.
* Set up custom API endpoints to communicate with external services.
* Fetch and display data from external APIs seamlessly.
* Automate processes based on specific website events or user interactions.

Convoworks bridges the gap between design and dynamic functionality, granting even non-coders the power to fully customize and automate their WordPress sites.

**Who can use this plugin and how?**

* **Website Owners**: If you're comfortable with tools like Elementor, you'll feel right at home with Convoworks. Use it to implement modifications on your website that would typically need coding knowledge. Dive into platforms like Amazon Alexa for voice interfaces or tap into the capabilities of GPT for chat functionalities and semantic searches. Now, you don't just design your site; you make it smarter and more interactive.

* **Agencies**: Convoworks offers a twofold advantage. First, with the support for service templates, agencies can rapidly deploy pre-defined solutions, cutting down the development time significantly. These ready-made solutions don't require the involvement of programmers, making deployment swift and hassle-free. Secondly, the platform is built with customization in mind. If you have unique challenges or specific problems to solve, you can easily design and integrate specialized workflow components into Convoworks. This flexibility ensures that you can simplify and optimize workflows tailored to your or your clients' needs.

* **Plugin Developers**: Elevate your plugin with the Convoworks custom package. Craft specialized components that hone in on your specific data or services, and establish a set of pre-defined service templates. These templates can cater to the most common requirements of your plugin users, allowing them to benefit from a robust, pre-configured solution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an Alexa-enabled device for development? =

While it's not essential to have an Alexa-enabled device, it's advisable if you're developing for Alexa. You can simulate some of the functionalities using the Alexa GUI simulator and Alexa apps, but to fully experience and test all features, a real device is recommended.

= Can I create Alexa skills unrelated to my website data? =

Absolutely. While Convoworks is a tool designed for WordPress, it isn’t limited to it. Whether you want to develop games for Alexa or fetch information from external sources to present as an Alexa skill, Convoworks gives you the flexibility to do so.

= Is it possible to create smart home Alexa skills? =

Currently, no. We don’t offer support for smart home interfaces and have no plans to do so in the near future.

= What is visual programming in Convoworks? =

Visual programming in Convoworks lets users design workflows by simply dragging and dropping components. With visual programming, even those without coding expertise can design complex workflows.

= How does the GPT package in Convoworks function? =

[Convoworks' GPT package](https://github.com/zef-dev/convoworks-gpt) offers an integration with the OpenAI GPT API. Not only does it provide basic API access, but it also incorporates advanced components allowing dynamic context insertion and control over conversation length. This ensures seamless and sophisticated AI-driven capabilities in workflows.

= Can Convoworks integrate with platforms other than Amazon Alexa? =

Yes, Convoworks supports various platforms like Viber, FB Messenger, web chat, and more. Its platform adapters ensure smooth communication across different channels.

= I'm familiar with WordPress visual builders like Elementor. How does Convoworks fit into this ecosystem? =

Convoworks complements visual builders by providing a similar interface for creating workflows. It bridges the gap between visual web design and dynamic functionality, all without coding.

= How does the WordPress Hooks integration work in Convoworks? =

Convoworks allows you to handle and respond to WordPress hooks (both actions and filters), enabling modifications to websites without needing to code. Through its intuitive interface, you can set up workflows to react to specific WordPress events, creating dynamic and interactive experiences on your site.
